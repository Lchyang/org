For simplicity we will assume that lists cannot contain duplicate(重复）items.

comma-delimited 逗号分隔

We need to be sure that we maintain(维持）the relative positioning(相对位置) of the items.

There is no requirement that we maintain that positioning in contiguous （连续）memory.

It is important to note the location of the first item of the list must be explicitly specified(具体说明）

The external(外部）reference(引用）is often referred to as the head of the list.

each linked to the next by explicit references(显示引用）
