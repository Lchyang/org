we need to address(处理，解决） the important question of where in the linked list to place the new item.

The next methods that we will implement-size, search, and remove-are all based on a technique（方法，技术） know as linked list traversal.(链表遍历）

Traversal refers to(指的是） the process of（的过程） systematically（有条理的） visiting each node.

assignment statement（任务声明）（赋值语句）

As an example, consider invoking(调用，使用） the search method looking the item 17.

As you can see the overall infrastructure(基础设施) is fully micro-service(微服务）based and the logic(逻辑) completely separated(分离), even with different technologies.

But there is a catch(不利因素): because the language is easy to learn and put to use, many practicing Python programmers leverage(利用) only a fraction of(一小部分) its powerful features.

This book is not A-to-Z exhaustive reference(全面的参考) of Python. Its emphasis(强调，侧重点) is on the language features that are either unique to Python or not found in many other popular languages.
