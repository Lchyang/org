We will take advantage of the logarithmic(对数) nature of the binary tree to represent our heap.

In order to guarantee(保证) logarithmic performance(性能)

A balanced binary tree has roughly(大致）the same number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the root.

The bad news about appending is that we will very likely violate(违反) the heap structure property.

swap(交换)

Quirky(古怪的） or witty（诙谐，富有机智） sense of humor

Exceptional at mathematics or spatial reasoning(空间推理).

regain(恢复)

Figure2(插图）shows the series of swaps needed to percolate(扩散) the newly added item up to its proper position in the tree.

We are also preserving the heap property for any siblings(兄弟姐妹）.

Since the heap property requires(要求) that the root of the tree be the smallest item in the tree.
